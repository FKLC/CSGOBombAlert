## Will I get ban for using this?

Well, the answer is I don't know but I don't think so because program only uses [CS:GO Game State Integration API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration) which is completely legal but as I said, you can get ban for using it.

**I do not guarantee you that you will not get banned for using this.**
